### Install build dependencies with ASDF

Install [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/).

Install the plugins and versions specified in `.tool-versions`

```bash
asdf plugin add ruby
asdf plugin add nodejs
asdf plugin add yarn
asdf install
```

When the versions are updated in main run `asdf install` again to update your
installation.

(We don't mandate asdf, you can use other tools if you prefer.)
