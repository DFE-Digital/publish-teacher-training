# 1. Record architecture decisions in teacher-training-api

Date: 2019-12-18

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made for the manage-courses and
find-courses projects. However, this project has multiple repositories, so we
could keep a record here, or in it's own repo. I don't think creating another
repo is good, if anything we've been considering moving repos together in the
future, so how about we create an ADR here.

## Decision

We will keep the ADR in this repo. Additionally, we'll create ADRs in the other
repos that are part of this project with pointers to look in this repo recorded
in the ADR.

## Consequences

Will have a record of the architectural decisions we make for this project and
the services involved. People looking for an ADR in the repos for these services
will have to be redirected to here.
