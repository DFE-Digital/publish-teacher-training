    <p class="govuk-body">This service is run by the Becoming a Teacher team at the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use the service. For example, that means users should be able to:</p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
      <li>zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
      <li>navigate most of the service using just a keyboard</li>
      <li>navigate most of the service using speech recognition software</li>
      <li>listen to most of the content on the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">We’ve also made the text on the service as simple as possible to understand.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body"><%= govuk_link_to "AbilityNet", "https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/" %> has advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.</p>

To ensure the service fully meets the WCAG 2.1 AA standard, we are currently arranging an accessibility audit.
