    <p class="govuk-body">
      We know from our research with candidates that understanding where their initial teacher training (ITT) will take place is one of the most important factors when choosing a course.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Over 80% of course searches on Find postgraduate teacher training (Find) are done by location, so it’s important that all location details have been added so courses can be found easily in searches.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">To be able to publish a course, you’ll need to attach at least one school and at least one study site to it.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      You can add all potential schools and study sites to your account in Publish teacher training courses (Publish) and then link them to a course.

    <h2 id="adding-a-school" class="govuk-heading-m">Adding a school</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body"> To add details about a school, go to the ‘Schools’ tab.</p>

    <%= image_tag("add-school.png", class: "govuk-!-margin-bottom-3") %>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once you’ve entered the details, check they are correct and select ‘Add school’. If you cannot find the school, you can enter it manually.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll see a list of all schools you’ve added, and you’ll be able to select the name of the school to edit or remove it.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body govuk-inset-text">You will not be able to remove a school if it has been attached to a course. You’ll need to detach it from the course first before you can remove it.</p>

      If you are concerned about the time taken to add this information, especially if your organisation works with many placement schools, please email us at  <%= govuk_mail_to bat_contact_email_address %> and we can add the information for you.

    <h2 id="adding-a-study-site" class="govuk-heading-m">Adding a study site</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      A study site is the location where the trainee will do the theoretical part of their training, for example, a university campus. If you cannot find the study site, you can enter it manually.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ll need at least one study site attached to a course to be able to publish it, but you can add as many as you like.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Once you’ve added schools and study sites to your account, you can attach them to a course. Candidates will then be able to see a list of the school placements and study sites on the course page on Find.

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">When adding a new course</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">When you add a new course, you’ll be asked to select all the school placements and study sites that apply.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you want to detach a school or study site from a course, you can select the change links as described above, untick the check box and update.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If there are no places left at a school or the study site is no longer available, you can detach it from a course. If a place becomes available, you can simply attach it again.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you need to remove a school or a study site from your account entirely, you’ll need to go to the ‘Schools’ or Study sites’ tab to do this.
