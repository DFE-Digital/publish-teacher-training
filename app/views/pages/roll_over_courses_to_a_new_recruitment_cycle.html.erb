        Roll over courses to a new recruitment cycle
    </h1>
    <p class="govuk-body">
    From this year, we will copy your courses from one recruitment cycle to the next in early September. This means you can update courses from the previous cycle, rather than having to create new ones.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
    Previously, this happened in July, however, we have found that vast majority of providers did not interact with those courses until the middle of September.
    </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Recruitment cycle</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      The year in which candidates are applying for courses and recruited, for example,
      ‘Recruitment cycle <%= next_recruitment_cycle_period_text %>’.
   </p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Academic year</h2>

     <p class="govuk-body">
        The year that follows the recruitment cycle in which candidates start their training, for example,
        ‘Academic year <%= next_academic_cycle_period_text %>’.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Publishing rolled over courses</h2>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      We’ll email you at the beginning of September to let you know when we’ve rolled over your courses.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      There’ll be an additional section in Publish teacher training courses called ‘Recruitment cycles’ where you can manage rolled over courses
      for the new cycle. You’ll be able to:
    </p>

    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>add courses</li>
      <li>edit courses</li>
      <li>remove courses</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">
      When your course is ready, you can publish it. It will not go live on
      <%= govuk_link_to("#{t('service_name.find')} (Find)", t("links.find_website_url")) %>
      straight away. Instead, the course will be ‘Scheduled’ until Find opens at the beginning of October.
      Candidates will then be able to search for your course.
    </p>
