    <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Publish teacher training courses privacy notice</h1>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we are</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      This work is being carried out by Department for Education (DfE) Digital, which is a part of DfE. For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data controller for the personal data processed as part of Publish teacher training courses (&#8216;Publish&#8217;).
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why our use of your personal data is lawful</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. For the purpose of this service, this processing is necessary to complete a task in the public interest as stated under GDPR Article 6 (1)(e).
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What personal information we will store</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">For all users, we will store:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your pseudonymised Internet Protocol (IP) address</li>
      <li>email addresses you share with us</li>
      <li>telephone numbers you share with us</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="govuk-body">When we create an account for you, we will store:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>your name</li>
      <li>your email address</li>
      <li>personal information, such as the name and email address of a contact person at your training provider or school, if you choose to share this in a course listing you post to Publish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we will use your information</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We store your IP address in order to track traffic to the service and continuously improve our service to better meet users&#8217; needs. If you use other digital services for which the data controller is also the DfE (for example, Manage postgraduate teacher training applications), we may also use your IP address to understand how you are using these services. This allows us to ensure that public funds are being spent effectively.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Personally identifiable contact information that is published in course listings is available in the public domain via an application programming interface (API). We are not responsible for how a third party handles any personal information you choose to include in a course listing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Sharing your personal data with other organisations</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      We sometimes need to make personal data available to other organisations. These might include contracted partners (who we have employed to process your personal data on our behalf) and/or other organisations (with whom we need to share your personal data for specific purposes).
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Where we need to share your personal data with others, we ensure that this data sharing complies with data protection legislation. We share specific types of personal data with our contracted suppliers, who have been contracted by DfE to manage the delivery of the digital service.
    </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">Our contracted suppliers use your data data in the following way</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>for user research that informs development of the service: if you share your name, email address and phone number our contracted suppliers will store these in its research library</li>
      <li>
        for security purposes: our contracted suppliers collect part of the IP addresses of people visiting the Publish teacher training courses website (for example, if we were receiving continuous direct denial of service attacks from an IP address range then we could block it)
      </li>
      <li>to enable users to use the service and receive updates: our contracted suppliers collect the names and emails of those publishing course listings on &#8216;Publish teacher training courses&#8217;</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we will keep your personal data</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Neither DfE nor its contracted suppliers will keep your personal data longer than we need it for the purpose(s) of research, security and/or delivery of the service, and in any case not longer than 7 years. Your data will be securely deleted when DfE and its contracted suppliers no longer need it for these purposes, or when 7 years have passed, whichever comes first.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      If you share personal information in a course listing we will retain this while the course is live and for one year after it has expired.
