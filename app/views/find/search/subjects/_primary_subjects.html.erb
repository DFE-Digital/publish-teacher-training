      As a trainee primary teacher you’ll learn to teach all subjects across the national curriculum.

    <p class="govuk-body">
      Some courses also enable you to develop your knowledge of a particular subject. When you’re a teacher, you could
      take on a role to influence the way it’s taught in your school - for example, mentoring your teacher colleagues
      to teach that subject better.
