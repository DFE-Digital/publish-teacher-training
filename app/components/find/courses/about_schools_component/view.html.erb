        All trainee teachers must complete a minimum of two placements with our secondary placements arranged through an A-B-A model. This means that the trainee will be placed in a ‘home school’ for the autumn term, an ‘alternative school’ placement runs from January to Easter. Following Easter, the trainee will return to their ‘home’ school until the end of the programme at the start of July.

        We believe in the power of choice and work with successful applicants to cater towards providing them ‘home school’ placements in their chosen academies within our Trust. Trainees are able to select a preferred home school before submitting their application.

      <p class="govuk-body">
        ‘Alternative school’ placements are chosen considering a number of factors, including trainee prior experience, training needs and location.

      Throughout the course, trainees engage with professional development training which takes an evidence-informed approach to teaching and learning. Whilst the majority of training takes place at One Angel Square, some training will take place at our Hubs, academies and through online seminars.

      <p class="govuk-body">
      Intensive Training and Practice (ITaP) is an additional element, taking place over 20 days of the programme. The ITaP grants trainees the opportunity to work with expert practitioners, access the latest and most pertinent research and allows trainees to take their learning further with an intensive focus on a specific, granular area of pedagogy. The four areas we have identified as beneficial to our trainees’ learning and development are:
