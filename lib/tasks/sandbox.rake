namespace :sandbox do
  desc <<~DESC
    Accepts a csv file path of users to be given access to the sandbox environment.
    The file is expected to be in the following format:

    name,email_address,provider
    Dave Test,dave@example.com,Provider name SCITT

    The name will be split first name, last name. Provider name must match exactly with the provider in the API.

    Users will be created if they don't exist already.
    They will then be added to the provider if they aren't associated already.
    Providers are not created, if they don't exist the task will log this and skip the user.

    provider_type options -> "lead_school", "scitt", "unknown", "university"
    provider_code must be a unique string

    Providers will be created if they don't exist, along with a single
    Organisation and Site per-provider.
