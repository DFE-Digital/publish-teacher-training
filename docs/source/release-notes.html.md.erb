# Release Notes

## 31 March 2022

We have introduced two new fields to the `CourseAttributes` schema which provide a way to determine availability for visa sponsorships with regards to individual courses.

- Add `can_sponsor_skilled_worker_visa` field to `CourseAttributes`. This is a boolean field which returns true if a skilled worker visa can be sponsored for a course.
- Add `can_sponsor_student_visa` field to `CourseAttributes`. This is a boolean field which returns true if a student visa can be sponsored for a course.

## 5 March 2021

- Add `subject_codes` field to `CourseAttributes`. This is an array of two-digit subject codes as strings, corresponding to subjects available on the `/subjects` endpoint.

## v1.0 - 13 March 2020
