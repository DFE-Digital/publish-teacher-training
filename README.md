# Publish Teacher Training Courses

## Prerequisites

### Native

- PostgreSQL 11
- GraphViz (`brew install graphviz`, or the equivalent with your package manager)

### Docker

- docker
- docker-compose

## Setting up the app in development

### Native

#### Install build dependencies

Install [asdf-vm](https://asdf-vm.com/).

Install the plugins and versions specified in `.tool-versions`

```bash
asdf plugin add ruby
asdf plugin add nodejs
asdf plugin add yarn
asdf install
```

When the versions are updated in main run `asdf install` again to update your
installation.

(We don't mandate asdf, you can use other tools if you prefer.)

#### Run the builds

Run the following commands:

```bash
yarn
bundle
bundle exec rails db:setup
```

#### Run the server

You can use [Foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) or [Overmind](https://github.com/DarthSim/overmind) to run all the processes needed for local dev. Once you have either of the two, you can run:

```bash
./bin/dev
```

Which will fire off the Rails server, watchers for JS/CSS changes and Sidekiq. You can also run them individually:

```bash
./bin/dev web
```

You don't have to use either of those tools. The script just wraps up the following commands:

```bash
### Updated
yarn build --watch
yarn build:css --watch
bin/rails server -p 3001
bundle exec sidekiq -t 25 -C config/sidekiq.yml
```
### Docker

Run this in a shell and leave it running:

```
docker-compose up --build --detach
```

You can then follow the log output with

```
docker-compose logs --follow
```

The first time you run the app, you need to set up the databases. With the above command running separately, do:

```
docker-compose exec web /bin/sh -c "bundle exec rails db:setup"
```

Then open http://localhost:3001 to see the app.

### Run The Server in SSL Mode

By default the server does not run in SSL mode. If you want to run the local
server in SSL mode, you can do so by setting the environment variable
`SETTINGS__USE_SSL`, for example, use this command to run the server:

```bash
SETTINGS__USE_SSL=1 rails s
```

### Trust the TLS certificate

Depending on your browser you may need to add the automatically generated SSL
certificate to your OS keychain to make the browser trust the local site.

On macOS:

```bash
sudo security add-trusted-cert -d -r trustRoot -k /Library/Keychains/System.keychain config/localhost/https/localhost.crt
```

## Running specs

```
bundle exec rspec
```

Or through guard (`--no-interactions` allows the use of `pry` inside tests):

```bash
bundle exec guard --no-interactions
```

### Running specs in parallel

When running specs in parallel for the first time you will first need to set up
your test databases.

`bundle exec rails parallel:setup`

To run the specs in parallel:
`bundle exec rails parallel:spec`

To drop the test databases:
`bundle exec rails parallel:drop`


## Architectural Decision Record

See the [docs/adr](docs/adr) directory for a list of the Architectural Decision
Record (ADR). We use [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools) to manage
our ADRs, see the link for how to install (hint: `brew install adr-tools` or use
ASDF).

## Linting

It's best to lint just your app directories and not those belonging to the framework:

```bash
bundle exec rubocop app config db lib spec --format clang

or

docker-compose exec web /bin/sh -c "bundle exec rubocop app config db lib spec Gemfile --format clang"
```

## Running specs, linter (with auto correct) and annotate models and serializers

```
bundle exec rake
```

## Accessing API

### V2

#### Authentication

Authenticating with V2 of the API relies on an email address of an existing user
in the database being supplied as the bearer token.

An example HTTP request would look like:

```
GET /api/v2/recruitment_cycles.json
Authorization: Bearer <encoded JWT token>
```

or with curl:

```bash
curl http://localhost:3001/api/v2/recruitment_cycles.json -H "Authorization: Bearer <encoded JWT token>"
```

## Settings vs config vs Environment variables

Refer to the [the config gem](https://github.com/railsconfig/config#accessing-the-settings-object) to understand the `file based settings` loading order.

To override file based via `Machine based env variables settings`

```bash
cat config/settings.yml
file
  based
    settings
      env1: 'some file based value'
```

```bash
export SETTINGS__FILE__BASED__SETTINGS__ENV1="machine wins"
```

```ruby
puts Settings.file.based.setting.env1

machine wins
```

Any `Machine based env variables settings` that is not prefixed with `SETTINGS`.\* are not considered for general consumption.

### Documentation

Use the following command to generate OpenAPI specification:

```sh
bundle exec rake rswag:specs:swaggerize
```

We use [Tech Docs](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-gem) to build documentation. To update documentation, the relevant files can be found in `/docs`. The docker build will then take these files to generate the static site.

To develop and preview the tech docs you can start and run with [Middleman](https://github.com/middleman/middleman)

```sh
cd docs && bundle install && bundle exec middleman
```

##Â CI variables

You'll need to define the `AZURE_CR_PASSWORD` in Travis in order to successfully build and publish. This can be done using this command:

```bash
travis encrypt AZURE_CR_PASSWORD="xxx" --add
```

## Sentry

To track exceptions through Sentry, configure the `SENTRY_DSN` environment variable:

```
SENTRY_DSN=https://aaa:bbb@sentry.io/123 rails s
```
